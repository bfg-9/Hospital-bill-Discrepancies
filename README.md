## Problem Statement

#### Healthcare institutions often face challenges such as variability in treatment outcomes, systematic billing errors across different payment types, and disparities in billing amounts based on insurance coverage. This project addresses these issues by predicting treatment outcomes, detecting billing errors, and analyzing patterns of billing disparities using Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models, supported by explainable AI techniques like SHAP, LIME, and ELI5.
